# README for "SQLiteToMySQL.ipynb"

## Overview
This notebook, "SQLiteToMySQL", is designed to facilitate the conversion of SQLite
database files (.db) into MySQL-compatible SQL files (.sql). While SQLite is a popular
choice for local databases, MySQL is often preferred for larger-scale applications. This
tool enables users to seamlessly migrate data and schema structures from SQLite to MySQL.

## Input
The notebook requires a list of SQLite database files (.db) as input. For our purpose we
are includeing: TPCH-3K.db, TPCH-6K.db, TPCH-12K.db, TPCH-120K.db. SQLite databases are
characterized by their .db extension and are supported by SQLite and similar database
systems, but not directly supported by MySQL.

## Purpose
MySQL does not natively support .db files. Hence, this program converts SQLite .db files
into .sql files, which contain SQL commands representing the database schema and data.
These generated SQL files can then be easily imported into MySQL, allowing users to
replicate the database structure and import datasets seamlessly.

## How to Run
1. Install anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/success
2. Open anaconda navigator and jupyter notebook.
3. Open SQLiteToMySQL.ipynb in jupyter notebook.
4. Adjust the directory configurations and the ".db" files location in the main block of the
   python file, '__main__'
5. Executing this python script creates converted .sql files for each of the .dbo file, which
   can then simply run in MySQL to create schema and insert datasets.

## Data Mapping
When converting datatypes from .db files to the corresponding MySQL datatypes the following 
mapping is used:
- 'TEXT': 'TEXT'
- 'INTEGER': 'INT'
- 'REAL': 'DOUBLE'
- 'BLOB': 'LONGBLOB'
- 'NULL': 'NULL'
- 'NUM' : 'DATE'



# README for "tpch_benchmark.ipynb"

Inputs: The following MySQL databases: 'cs505_prj_tpch_3k', 'cs505_prj_tpch_12k', 'cs505_prj_tpch_60k', 'cs505_prj_tpch_120k'.
the TPC-H query1 through query 22 were stored in MySQL as procedure view in the previous step.

How to execute the TPC-H benchmark queries:
the TPC-H query1 through query 22 were stored in MySQL as procedure view. The 

standard Query1 through Query22
Now these views are being executed through the python
script "tpch_benchmark.ipynb".

and corresponding data import was done in the previous step.
